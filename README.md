Credit to Credit to 3Blue1Brown, for the intuitive explanation of a Neural Network, found in the playlist here:

And to Michael Nielsen, for a more indepth explanation on the underlying mathematics of a Neural Network, and recommendations for future improvements, such as 
changing the cost function (currently mean-squared-error method) to a logarithm based one (cross-entropy), as well as exploring other activation functions, such as 
tanh, softmax, and rectified linear unit (ReLU).
